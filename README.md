## Some places to get tea in Atlanta, GA

The point of this is to share places I've enjoyed to get tea in Atlanta.  
I've especially focused on places to get loose-leaf and bubble tea (and less on Southern-style sweet tea / iced tea).  
Any places listed in the first few sections, I've visited personally and enjoyed. 
As always your mileage may vary, good luck on your tea exploration journey!
